# Email-Spam-Detection

This study compares the performance of several classification models in detecting email spam, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. The evaluation results indicate that the highest accuracy is achieved by the SVM model with a value of 72.19%, followed by Logistic Regression with 71.71%. However, the precision, recall, and f1-score in classifying spam show significant variations among these models. This research provides a comprehensive insight into the effectiveness of each model in addressing the problem of email spam detection..
